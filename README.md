# Drug-Protein-Interaction-Analysis-Toolkit

Drug information for the pathogen-targeted host proteins and pathogen proteins was retrieved from DrugBank [1]. This analysis tool provides to search drug information of host proteins or pathogen proteins within the PHIs of interest. Also, provides to detect drug-targeted proteins and non-drug targeted proteins, and calculate topological values (degree and betweenness centrality) [2]. Tool requires interested pathogen-host interaction data and graph analysis data and gives drug information of queried host proteins or pathogen proteins.
